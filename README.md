# Dx12Base
A small dx12 base program I use to test shaders and techniques


Make sure you update Dx12Base project *Additional library directory* to C:\Program Files x86\Windows Kits\10\bin\<YOURVERSION>\x64
and copy dxcompiler.dll next to the solution file. You will also need to copy dxil.dll for binaries to be signed.
Alternatively, you can download the latest version from [Microsoft github](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases)
and extract files into the *solution directory*.

In case your are using a different Visual Studio, or SDK version: right click on each projects and select *Retarget Projects*.
